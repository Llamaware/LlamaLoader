# AutoTomb

![preview](/img/preview.png)

An auto-updater and installer for the [Tomb modloader](https://codeberg.org/basil/tomb).

### Features

- **Attempts** to find your game directory.
- **Automatically** installs and updates Tomb.
- A **not-so-pretty** but easy-to-use GUI.
- **"Fake"** console output.
- Basically **zero QA testing**, so don't try putting gibberish into the text boxes.
- It took **a few hours** to make this.

### Requirements

- OS: Only works on Windows.
- You need the .NET 8.0 Runtime.

### Future improvements

- Multiplatform? (will require a complete rewrite)
- More verbose error logging.
- There probably still won't be any safety features. Just don't be stupid while using it.
